## Interactive Cooking Recipe Chatbot | HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6), jQuery, Bootstrap
* Architected a responsive Single Page Application (SPA) using Bootstrap’s grid system and card components to create a mobile-first chat interface, ensuring seamless usability across devices.
* Engineered a JavaScript/jQuery logic engine to simulate an intelligent conversational agent; implemented a key-value pair data structure to map user keywords (e.g., "fried rice," "roasting") to predefined culinary instructions and definitions.
* Implemented dynamic DOM manipulation to render message bubbles in real-time, utilizing custom CSS to visually distinguish between user inputs and bot responses for a clear dialogue flow.
* Optimized user interaction by programming robust event listeners for both 'click' and 'keypress' events, ensuring immediate, latency-free feedback loops during the simulated chat sessions.
